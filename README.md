# Expo CLI: Uncommon Library Integration Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive error in Expo projects when integrating third-party libraries that require native modules.  The error often lacks a clear or consistent message, making debugging difficult.

## Problem
The core issue stems from discrepancies between how Expo manages native modules in its managed workflow and the expectations of certain libraries.  These libraries may require specific linking steps or configurations that aren't automatically handled by Expo.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully examining the documentation of the problematic library.  Often, you will need to perform manual linking, specify correct build configurations, or potentially choose a different library with better compatibility with Expo's managed workflow.

This repository provides example code showcasing the error and its resolution.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal.
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Attempt to run the app: `expo start`
5. Observe the error.
6. Apply the solution in `bugSolution.js` and re-run.

## Disclaimer
The specific error and solution can change drastically depending on the library involved.  The example code provided illustrates a general pattern, not a particular case.
