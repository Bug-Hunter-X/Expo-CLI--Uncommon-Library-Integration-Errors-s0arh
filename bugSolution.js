The solution depends heavily on the specific library causing the issue.  However, common approaches include:

1. **Manual Linking (if necessary):** Some libraries may explicitly require manual linking of native modules. This often involves using the Expo CLI to link the native module.
   ```bash
expo install <library-name>
```

2. **Configuration Changes:** Consult the library's documentation for instructions on configuring it within an Expo environment.  This may require adding specific configurations to your `app.json` or `package.json` file.

3. **Using EAS Build (for more complex cases):**  For projects with complex native module dependencies, consider using Expo's EAS Build service for more robust native module handling. 

4. **Alternative Libraries:**  If the library proves too problematic to integrate, exploring alternative libraries that offer better Expo compatibility is a viable option.

**Example (Illustrative):**
Let's assume the problematic library was `react-native-sensitive-info`.  The solution might involve adding this to your `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "My App",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "userInterfaceStyle": "light",
    "scheme": "myapp",
    "plugins": [
      "expo-image-picker",
      "react-native-sensitive-info"
    ]
  }
}
```

Remember to replace `<library-name>` with the actual name of the problematic library.  Always refer to the official documentation for the correct steps.
