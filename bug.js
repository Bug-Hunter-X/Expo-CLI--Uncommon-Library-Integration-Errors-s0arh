This error typically occurs when you are using a library or package that has not been properly configured or linked within your Expo project.  It might manifest as a runtime error, a build error, or an unexpected behavior during app execution.  The underlying cause often lies in the interaction between Expo's managed workflow and the native modules required by the third-party library.
